# base_JavaProjTools_IRender
"Project" holding interface for rendering engine.  

This project consists of just an interface for rendering, describing the expected functions of a rendering window. If we ever wish to move away from Processing to another OpenGL lib, this is intended to be the interface that whatever rendering mechanism should follow.  Work In Progress.
